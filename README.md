# floorplan.js
Basic floorplan API for javascript.

Usage
---
Currently floorplan.js is under refactoring. You can see the example in action though, just clone and run it in your browser.

Floorplan.js is AMD compatible. So to all those Require.js fans out there, eat your heart out!

A working concept is included in [Androidscantnavigate](https://github.com/ikbenpinda/Androidscantnavigate), a working Android proof-of-concept for floorplan.js in an Android WebView.
